# CTSegmentationCNN
Used dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vbookshelf/computed-tomography-ct-images

Used Unet architecture https://github.com/nikhilroxtomar/Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-in-TensorFlow-2.0/blob/main/UNET/unet.py

The CNN have to be trained in more epochs to get better results.
In future next training also I want to add dice coefficient to get the better view of the results.
